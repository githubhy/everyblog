<p>I created a log table to log the everyday pieces my daughter needs to practice.</p>
<p>After almost 2 yearsâ€™ practice, she got a steady and smooth progress now. The tutor are giving more and more pieces to her every week. We often missed some piece in the practice. So I created the following table for her to let her, also me ðŸ˜…, keep track of the process everyday, turning the task slightly into a game.</p>
<p>So the table is like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://githubhy.github.io/everyblog/posts/voilin-log-table/violin_homework_log.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The first column of this table is the pieces that she needs to practice. They are going to change every week, depending on what the tutor will teach.</p>
<p>Other columns are the status of the practice for each piece. We do not need to practice all the pieces every day. So at the start of the practice, a list of pieces could be made, where we could mark the items in it on the table with a small circle âšª or something like that.</p>
<p>If she completed a certain piece, she could mark it as âœ…. You do not know how much she loves this, based on my speculation on her todayâ€™s session ðŸ˜†.</p>
