    "text": "After almost 2 yearsâ€™ practice, she got a steady and smooth progress now. The tutor are giving more and more pieces to her every week. We often missed some piece in the practice. So I created the following table for her to let her, also me ðŸ˜…, keep track of the process everyday, turning the task slightly into a game.\nSo the table is like this:\n\n\n\nViolin Homework Log\n\n\nThe first column of this table is the pieces that she needs to practice. They are going to change every week, depending on what the tutor will teach.\nOther columns are the status of the practice for each piece. We do not need to practice all the pieces every day. So at the start of the practice, a list of pieces could be made, where we could mark the items in it on the table with a small circle âšª or something like that.\nIf she completed a certain piece, she could mark it as âœ…. You do not know how much she loves this, based on my speculation on her todayâ€™s session ðŸ˜†."
